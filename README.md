# osTicket public Dashboard
Public Dashboard butilt on bootstrap and the SB-ADMIN-2 template to show closed tickets open tickets etc.

This is a dashboard for osTicket displaying how many closed tickets there are, current amount of open tickets,
and a simple count down timer (pratically done manually) for the days left in the school year. It is easly customizable.

To use this just put it in your home directory of ostticket.
Then update your sql User / Password / Database in the /pages/index.php

I am a working on showing the current open work orders but haven't goten the code correct yet. 
If you would like to help, please do... it will be greatly appreciated.
